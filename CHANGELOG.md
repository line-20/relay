# Changelog

All notable changes to Relay. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org); the plugin's
version lives in `plugins/relay/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

To pick up a new version, colleagues refresh via the `/plugin` manager — `/plugin marketplace
update line-20` then update the `relay` plugin. Their repos' `relay/` folders are their own
data and are never touched by an update.

## 0.2.0

**Added**
- **`/brainstorm`** — the front of the loop. Turns a rough idea into a shaped brief on the
  board: it interrogates the idea one theme at a time, weighs two or three real alternatives
  (keeping the product/UX lens separate from the architecture/data-model lens), recommends
  one, and writes `relay/briefs/<slug>.md` + a board row. It never builds — `/next` picks the
  item up when you're ready. The full loop is now
  `/brainstorm → /next → /wrapup → /handover`.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- **Commands:** `/relay-init`, `/next`, `/continue`, `/review-pr`, `/fix-pr-review`,
  `/wrapup`, `/handover`, `/start-new`.
- **Review agents** (dispatched by `/review-pr`): backend, frontend, ui-ux, api-architect,
  dbms, test-engineer, security, privacy, i18n, solution-architect — all stack-agnostic.
- **Meta-skill:** `authoring-skills`, for adding your own commands and agents.
- **Docs:** quickstart, the board model, a day in the loop, authoring guide.
- All workflow state namespaced under a single `relay/` folder in the target repo.
